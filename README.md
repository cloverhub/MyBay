# Udacity FE Web Developer Project 5: Neighborhood Map

## How to Use the Web App:
- Open the [MyBay App](http://shawnclover.com/apps/mybay)
- By default, the map displays a list and markers of many of my personal favorite places in the San Francisco Bay Area
- Optionally click any filter categories to deselect/reselect categories to the search results
- Optionally type any letters for a location in the search box to narrow results
- Click a location in either the list or click a marker on the map for details on the location
- My personal review appears in the map infowindow
- Foursquare and/or Wikipedia information appears below the map for each location

## Additional Features:
- The location list, photos, and my review are all touch-scrollable on mobile devices or a mouse scrollwheel can be used
- Phone number, website, photos, and a link back to the venue on Foursquare appear when data is available in Foursquare for the selected location
- A snippet from Wikipedia appears with a link to the full article when a Wikipedia article is available for the selected location
- Some locations have multiple categories and the app ensures that the location information is not repeated in these cases
