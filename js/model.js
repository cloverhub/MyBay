The pizzas are single serving-sized and a bit crispified underneath. The whole theme of the pizza style and vanilla ice cream thing are straight from Boot and Shoe Service in Oakland, but that's fine by me because I love that place too.<br/><br/>They seem to have a pizza management problem. We were expecting the pasta and the pizza to arrive at the same time, but instead we watched people sit down next to us after we arrived, order two pizzas, finish their pizzas and dessert and leave before our pizza even arrived. It was over an hour for one pizza.<br/><br/>Looking forward to repeat visits since I live across the street...just hope they can speed up the pizzas a bit.",

The expo was born from an idea to celebrate the completion of San Francisco Bay’s two new bridges. In 1933, the Bridge Celebration Founding Committee was formed to come up with a plan for the celebration. Candlestick Point was considered as a site, but the wise committee knew that was a ridiculous place to put any sort of recreational facility. Since we were celebrating the two bridges, why not celebrate right between them? After a few necessary approvals and a big thumbs up from President FDR, a 400 acre manmade island smack dab in the middle of San Francisco Bay began to take shape. The rocks already piled up what was then called Yerba Buena Shoals were relocated and everything in between was filled with landfill by dredging mud from the bay. More on my website...",
