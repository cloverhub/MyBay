		"review": "Ordered nuvole pasta and a Market pizza along with caesar salad, drinks, and wine. The pasta was excellent as was the pizza. The pizzas are single serving-sized and a bit crispified underneath. The whole theme of the pizza style and vanilla ice cream thing are straight from Boot and Shoe Service in Oakland, but that's fine by me because I love that place too.</p><p>They seem to have a pizza management problem. We were expecting the pasta and the pizza to arrive at the same time, but instead we watched people sit down next to us after we arrived, order two pizzas, finish their pizzas and dessert and leave before our pizza even arrived. It was over an hour for one pizza.</p><p>Looking forward to repeat visits since I live across the street...just hope they can speed up the pizzas a bit.",

The pasta dishes are my personal favorite--these guys make pasta on par with the best Italian restaurants and pair it with delectable fall-off-the-bone meats. The pan-seared Salmon is really good too.</p><p>Don't come here in a hurry--working through a three-course meal can go on for hours in typical French fashion. Rather than a quiet atmosphere, you'll typically see a more lively (loud) crowd in here with upbeat (sometimes even Reggae) music in the air.",

I've had a family membership for years and bring the family in often. This is one of the best places around to bring kids--they will have fun and can't help but learn along the way. When the new location first opened, I missed the old dark, dank, cavernous feel of the original location, but the location, capacity, and overall atmosphere of the new location seems natural now. The food and waterfront view aren't bad either.</p><p>I've been to hands-on science museums around the world that have followed the Exploratorium's model, but the Exploratorium is the original and still the best.",
